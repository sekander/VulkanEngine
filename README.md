Here‚Äôs a combined high-level overview of your **Vulkan Renderer Project** without any code ‚Äî describing its structure, shader capabilities, and system design:

# üéÆ Vulkan Renderer Project Overview

This project is a modern and modular **3D rendering engine** built with **Vulkan**, emphasizing flexibility, performance, and advanced graphics effects. It combines a robust **state management system** with a powerful, extensible **shader pipeline**, making it suitable for both real-time applications and experimental graphics research.

---

## üåê Rendering Engine Highlights

At its core, the renderer leverages Vulkan‚Äôs low-level control to achieve high efficiency and scalability. It supports features such as:

* **Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)** for realistic materials and lighting.
* **Advanced Shader Techniques** including toon shading, SDF effects, and normal mapping.
* **Geometry Shader Support** for dynamic primitive manipulation.
* **Push Constants** for low-latency data communication between CPU and GPU.

---

## üé® Shader System Overview

The engine comes equipped with a **comprehensive shader suite**, designed for both traditional and stylized rendering:

* **PBR and Phong Lighting** models for realistic and legacy styles.
* **Normal Mapping** to enhance surface detail without increasing mesh complexity.
* **Toon Shading** for a cel-shaded, non-photorealistic visual style.
* **SDF (Signed Distance Field)** techniques for crisp outlines, glow effects, or volumetric representations.
* **Wireframe and Outline Shaders** for debugging or stylistic visualization.

Each shader type (vertex, fragment, geometry) is modular and cleanly separated to facilitate experimentation and easy replacement.

## üì¶ State Management System

The renderer is tightly coupled with a **stack-based state machine** to manage application flow. This supports:

* **Scene Isolation**: Each state (e.g., Menu, Gameplay, Game Over) has its own lifecycle.
* **Extensibility**: Developers can quickly create new states using a built-in template.
* **Full Lifecycle Hooks**: Initialization, updates, rendering, and clean-up are well-defined.

### Common States Included:

* Main Menu: With model previews and interaction.
* Gameplay: With full 3D rendering and entity logic.
* Loading: Transitional visual state for async operations.
* Splash Screen: Logo or intro branding.
* Game Over: Post-game summary screen.
* Template: For rapid prototyping new modes or tools.

## üèó Asset and Scene Management

* **Assimp Integration** enables loading of various 3D model formats.
* Scene transformations support full 3D spatial manipulation using quaternions.
* Entity rendering respects lighting, materials, and shader effects assigned.

---

## ü™Ñ Ideal Use Cases

* Real-time applications and games requiring custom rendering paths.
* Educational platforms for learning Vulkan and advanced graphics.
* Prototyping stylized or physically-accurate shaders.
* Debugging and visualization tools with UI overlays.
